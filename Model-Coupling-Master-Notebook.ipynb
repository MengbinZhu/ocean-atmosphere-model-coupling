    "\n",
    "- The atmosphere is much larger than the ocean (twice in every direction) but the resolution is say 5x less\n",
    "- I will exchange the values between the models at different times. If we couple every 10 days, I assume we start with the atmosphere driving the ocean, and 8 days later the ocean drives the atmosphere.\n",
